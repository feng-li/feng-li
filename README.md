### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m computing, forecasting and learning with massive machines.
- 👯 My code runs fast on distributed systems. See my [dstats](https://github.com/feng-li/dstats) (including [dlsa](https://github.com/feng-li/dlsa), [darima](https://github.com/xqnwang/darima), [dqr](https://github.com/feng-li/dqr) and more) repository.
- 💬 I teach [how to forecast at scale](https://feng.li/bdcf). Welcome to ask me anything about distributed statistical computing and forecasting.
- 🔬 My lab [KLLAB.org](https://kllab.org/) welcomes [university students](https://kllab.org/join-us/) and [visitors](https://kllab.org/collaborators/).
- 📢 I am seeking motivated PhD candidates in Statistics to join my team. The ideal candidates will have a strong foundation in statistical theory and computational skills. Successful candidates will engage in cutting-edge research, benefit from an interdisciplinary environment, and contribute to advancements in statistics and related fields.
- 📫 Reach me via [https://feng.li](https://feng.li/) and [🐦@f3ng.li](https://twitter.com/f3ngli) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a Bayesian, and I program with `terminal` [`Emacs`](https://github.com/feng-li/.emacs.d).
- ☕ I drink good quality coffee and enjoy the Swedish [_**fika**_](https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/all-about-swedish-fika/) time with family and friends.
