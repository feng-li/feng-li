### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m computing, forecasting and learning with massive machines.
- 👯 My code runs on the Spark distributed system. See my [dstats](https://github.com/feng-li/dstats) (including [dlsa](https://github.com/feng-li/dlsa), [darima](https://github.com/xqnwang/darima), [dqr](https://github.com/feng-li/dqr) and more) repository.
- 💬 Welcome to ask me about distributed statistical computing.
- 🔬 My lab [KLLAB.org](https://kllab.org/) welcomes [university students](https://kllab.org/join-us/) and [visitors](https://kllab.org/collaborators/).
- 📫 Reach me via [https://feng.li](https://feng.li/) and [🐦@f3ng.li](https://twitter.com/f3ngli) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a Bayesian and I program with [Emacs](https://github.com/feng-li/.emacs.d).
- ☕ I drink good quality coffee and enjoy the [_fika_](https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/fika/) time with family and friends.
